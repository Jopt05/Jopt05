## Hello, my name is Jes√∫s Puentes.
Frontend/Backend developer with knowledge on ReactJs, ExpressJs and Python willing to expand my mind and learn new things everyday and be part of the upcoming challenges on the tech side of things.

Through my career I've worked with languages such as Javascript and Python and some of them frameworks and libraries. I love to create applications that solve day by day problems.
## Projects 
I like to create personal projects and achieve challenges from different sources to test and improve my tech skills. These are projects I've made on my own:

 1. [Github Profiles App](https://jopt05.github.io/frontendmentor-githubprofiles/)
 2. [Planet Facts App](https://jopt05.github.io/planet-facts-jopt05/)
 3. [Rock, Papper and Scissors](https://jopt05-rps.vercel.app/#/login)

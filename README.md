## Hi, my name is Jesús Puentes.
I'm a mechatronics engineer from the Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Coatzacoalcos and since I started university I fell in love with coding.

Through the school I had to setup mechatronics systems such as Arduino and PLC through TIA Portal Software.

When the quarantine started I wanted to become a developer so I improved my coding knowledge and since then I'm always studying to improve my skills to some day create a better future for me and those around me.
